# multibodyDynamics_model
The multibody dynamics model of insect flight for various morphologies. Directly relevant to Ch. 1 of my dissertation.


Callin TODO: 
- Check Ranges of forces and torques
- Make sure to not use nonlinear spring
- Make sure force originates slightly behind the center of head/thorax
- 0 velocity?
