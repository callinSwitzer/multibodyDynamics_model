#     4/4/17- Setting up my model (Model 1) in MATLAB using ode45
#     Models 2-7 since then (and even more errors/fixes)
#     Model 8 was essentially refined on 6/29/17
#     7/6/17- Model 9 development will incorporate our cost function and 
#         multiple wing strokes.
#     8/7/17- Model 10(a?) will do all of the above for SEVERAL full run 
#         throughs. Model 10(b?) will have a Gaussian cost function. 
#             a.k.a. no more window!
#     9/4/17- FIXED K and c
#     9/6/17- Fixed tau to have a maximum value of 10000 g*(cm^2)/(s^2)
#     2/8/18- Eliminated the need for global variables and implemented 
#         %structs that are passed into the ODE.
#     3/6/18- Model 11 is born.
#         Restructured the ENTIRE layout of the variables to have nested
#         structs which contain what we want.
#         hws contains a 2500x1 struct of: 
#             ICs, F, alpha, tau, Q, cost, NewICs
#         Each hws is nested in a 100x1 large struct for Qstore and Winstore
#     7/3/18- Fixed a MAJOR error in the resting angle of the torsional spring.
#         Now there is the appropriate restorative force.
#     7/18/18- Model 12 was born.
#         Fixed another MAJOR error. tau_abdo is now a fixed force (as
#         originally intended), needed to fix myODE and remove the
#         sinusoidal component of the applied torque.
#     ~8/17/18- Incorporated LengthScaleFactor to change the size of the model.
#     10/16/18- Incorporated Size
#     1/7/19- Finally attempting a formal Model Predictive Control (MPC)
#     1/31/19- Corrected issues pertaining to the Moment of Inertia.
#         myODE5 was born.
#         1) incorrect multiplication in myODE4,
#         2) accounting for parallel axis theorem (due to petiole length
#         extension) in myODE4.
#     2/14/19- For the sake of efficiency, lines 184, and 314 were muted
#         to no longer create the Qstore struct. 
# ** Conversion to Python **
#     2/25/19- Code being migrated to Python. This transition will switch to 
#         fixed time steps. This transition will likely lead to the use of a 
#         GPU or Amazon Web Services. 
#     4/8/19- Added wing torque term as a fourth control parameter (tau_w) to 
#         add the option of making the model fully actuated. I have also saved
#         the output of this file to be pre_Winstore. A MATLAB script will 
#         convert this file into the structure I desire in MATLAB. 
#         Single core processing.
#     4/11/19- Created multi-core verson of the code. This uses the @jit
#         decorator in the numba package to use multi-processing.
#     5/1/19- Went back to global variables (I know, it's not the best 
#         practice, but I have no patience at this time).
#     5/17/19- Got the sucker to run with huge help from Callin Switzer. Woo!

#     12b is for horizontal aggressive maneuver
#     12c is for vertical aggressive maneuver
